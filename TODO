-ODT export looks fugly due to grainy equations and large fonts, but maybe people never use those massive fonts in practice?
	-overrendering Latex images then shrinking them with width/height tags makes the HTML version look ugly instead (no smoothing).
-SVG support? 
	-use pdf2svg?
	-use dvisvgm? output seems weird on my first try at it.
	-firefox 3.6.15 (for example) does not support SVG in image tags, but firefox 4 does.
		- using object tag instead means no tooltip text, no linking.
	-perhaps a bit premature.
-MimeTex support
	-shouldn't be too hard to hack in. need to check if it supports \begin{} \end{} environments.
