-add troubleshooter to Admin panel
-ODT export looks fugly due to grainy equations and large fonts, but maybe people never use those massive fonts in practice?
-SVG support? 
	-use pdf2svg?
	-use dvisvgm? output seems weird on my first try at it.
	-firefox 3.6.15 (for example) does not support SVG in image tags, but firefox 4 does.
		- using object tag instead means no tooltip text, no linking.
	-perhaps a bit premature.
